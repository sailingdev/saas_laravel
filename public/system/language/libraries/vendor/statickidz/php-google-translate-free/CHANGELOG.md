## v2.0.0, released on 0:50 15/11/2016  
### New  
* Now the GoogleTranslate library it can import using PSR-4 autoload  
* The library is ready to upload to the composer service for much more simple installation  
* GoogleTranslate now has with it necessary to generate automatic documentation, see the observations for more information  
* Now Travis-CI is supported with PHPUnit tests  
* GoogleTranslate now have a GPL-3.0 licence to make more compatible with others licences. See the observations for more information  
### Modified  
* The library now has its namespace so that is more easy of implement, can see the files in the ' tests' folder for examples of use  
* The comments in the code were improved to facilitate the documentation generation, see the observations for more information
### Observations  
* The documentation is generated automatically using [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org)  
* I suggest the change of license to GPL because the previous  license enters in conflict with the same library, the PHP licence 3.0 prohibits the use of the word ' PHP' in the name of the library. In addition the License GPL is more compatible with other licenses and can promote the use of the library
